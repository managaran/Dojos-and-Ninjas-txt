# Dojos-and-Ninjas

Learning Objectives:

Students will create databases using the three types of relationships.

Students will use SQL queries.

In the previous chapter, you created the dojos_and_ninjas_schema. Now, you'll get the chance to forward engineer this schema, and use queries to manipulate the database. Try to put yourself in the mindset of a software engineer working at Coding Dojo. In this role, you need to manage the data Coding Dojo has on their Dojo locations, and the Ninjas who take classes at each site.


If you get stuck on retrieving, changing, or deleting dojos and ninjas, be sure to apply the 20 minute rule! Try re-reading the previous modules and doing research on your own, then reaching out to your peers on Discord, and finally setting up some time with a Coding Dojo staff member so that you talk through the challenge you're facing.

Forward engineer the dojos_and_ninjas_schema from the previous chapter

Create a .txt file where you'll save each of your queries from below

Query: Create 3 new dojos

Query: Delete the 3 dojos you just created

Query: Create 3 more dojos

Query: Create 3 ninjas that belong to the first dojo

Query: Create 3 ninjas that belong to the second dojo

Query: Create 3 ninjas that belong to the third dojo

Query: Retrieve all the ninjas from the first dojo

Query: Retrieve all the ninjas from the last dojo

Query: Retrieve the last ninja's dojo

Submit your .txt file that contains all the queries you ran in the shell
